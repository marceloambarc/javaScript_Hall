<p><b>is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. Variables are containers that store values. Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.<b></p>
<hr>
<h2># Arrays</h2>
<p> An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example)</p>
<br>
<h2># Avarage Numbers</h2>
<p>Finding the average value of a group of numbers is as easy as summing all of the numbers and dividing by the total number of numbers.</p>
<br>
<h2># Concat</h2>
<p> The concat method creates a new array consisting of the elements in the object on which it is called</p>
<br>
<h2># Constructor</h2>
<p>The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class.</p>
<br>
<h2># Factory Function</h2>
<p>A factory function is any function which is not a class or constructor that returns a (presumably new) object. In JavaScript, any function can return an object. When it does so without the new keyword, it's a factory function</p>
<br>
<h2># Models</h2>
<p>JavaScript follows a similar model, but does not have a class definition separate from the constructor. Instead, you define a constructor function</p>
<br>
<h2># Prime Numbers</h2>
<p>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.</p>
<br>
<h2># Remove Array</h2>
<p>When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements. This is what popping and pushing is</p>
<br>
<h2># Ternary Operator</h2>
<p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.</p>
<br>
<h2># Var and Let</h2>
<p>Main differences between VAR and LET and uses in console.log to view possible errors in the global, local and block scope</p>  
<br>
<h2># Params</h2>
<p>Arguments are Passed by Value. The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value.</p>
<br>
<h2># JSON</h2>
<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.</p>
<br>
<h2># Spread Operator</h2>
<p>Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.</p>
<br>
<h2># Destructuring Assignment</h2>
<p>The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.</p>
<br>
<h2># Arrow Function</h2>
<p>An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.</p>
<br>
<h2># Find</h2>
<p>The find() method executes the function once for each element present in the array: If it finds an array element where the function returns a true value, find() returns the value of that array element (and does not check the remaining values) Otherwise it returns undefined.</p>
<br>
<h2># Template Literals</h2>
<p>Template Literals are a new ES2015 / ES6 feature that allows you to work with strings in a novel way compared to ES5 and below. The syntax at a first glance is very simple, just use backticks instead of single or double quotes: const a_string = `something`</p>
<br>
<h2># Async Functions</h2>
<p>An async function is a function declared with the async keyword. Async functions are instances of the AsyncFunction constructor, and the await keyword is permitted within them. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.</p>
<br>
<h2># Classes</h2>
<p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes; In the folder some exemples of contructions.</p>
<br>
<h2># File System</h2>
<p>Node.js as a File Server The Node.js file system module allows you to work with the file system on your computer. To include the File System module, use the require() method: var fs = require('fs');</p>
<br>
<h2># API Rest</h2>
<p>Representational state transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style</p>  
<h2># KNEX</h2>
<p>Knex can be used as an SQL query builder in both Node.JS and the browser, limited to WebSQL's constraints (like the inability to drop tables or read schemas).</p>
<h2># Socket.Io</h2>
<p>Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.</p>
<h2># wbm-modified</h2>
<p>wbm-modified is an unofficial API using wbm to send bulk messages in whatsapp.</p>
